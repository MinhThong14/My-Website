<span style="font-weight:600">I'm driven by embedded systems, distributed systems, and quantum computing. </span>My experience has ranged from a Research Assistant for a post-quantum cryptography project at [Carleton University School of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/) to Tooling and Performance engineering for an infrastructure monitoring solution at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) to Data Analysis for a data catalog project at [Innovapost](https://innovapost.com/) Data Architecture team, to working on Full Stack Software Developer at [Knak](https://knak.com/), a startup where I am wearing many hats from doing front-end, back-end and integration. I also did TAships at [Carleton University School of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/) working with [Prof. Pat Morin](https://cglab.ca/~morin/), [Prof. Michiel Smid](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~michiel/), [Prof. Mathew Holden](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~matthewholden/), [Instructor. Darryl Hill](https://carleton.ca/scs/people/darryl-hill/), [Instructor. Alina Shaikhet](https://carleton.ca/scs/people/alina-shaikhet-2/) in `COMP 2804` Discrete Structure II, `COMP 2404` Introduction to Software Engineering, and `COMP 2402` Abstract Data Types and Algorithms, hosting 100+ hrs of office hours, helping 1000+ students understand course materials and giving constructive criticism on their assignments.
