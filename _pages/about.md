<span style="font-weight:600">I'm driven by high-performance, scalable systems for big data and ML applications. </span> I'm interested in AI/ML- related projects at scale where I can apply algorithms and user-centric approaches to improve life. My experience has ranged from Tooling and Performance engineering for an infrastructure monitoring solution at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) to Data Analysis for a data catalog project at [Innovapost](https://innovapost.com/) Data Architecture team, to working on Full Stack Software Developer at [Knak](https://knak.com/), a startup where I am wearing many hats from doing front-end, back-end and integration. I also did TAships at [Carleton University School of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/) working with [Prof. Pat Morin](https://cglab.ca/~morin/), [Prof. Michiel Smid](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~michiel/), and [Prof. Mathew Holden](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~matthewholden/) in `COMP 2804` Discrete Structure II hosting 80+ hrs of office hours, helping 1000+ students understand course materials and giving constructive criticism on their assignments.

<span style="font-weight:600">Biography: </span> I am a senior student in Honours Bachelor of Computer Science at [Carleton University School of Computer Science](https://carleton.ca/scs/). I was nominated to [Carleton's Dean Honour List](https://carleton.ca/awards/2020-2021-deans-honour-list-2/) in  2020 and 2021. I also received `Michael Oliver Scholarship` in 2020 and `George Fierheller Scholarship` in 2021.
